        <h2>What I want to acomplish with Da Dex</h2>
        <p>Da Dex aims to create the easeiest way to trade digital assets of any kind. I want to create a exchange where there is the smallest commission fee on every trade.  every trader will be valued the same.</p>
         <ul>
          <li> everything about the Da Dex will be transparent and braoad casted.</li>
          <li>What does this mean? When I find a new dex I run into a probelem.  I feel like I need to read everything about them before I interact with my wallet. I want to create a dex where trust betwen user and exchnge is valued over anything.  so when I say "broadcasted" I want to have a way to show off that we are super transparent.  so users feel safe connecting their wallet and interacting with the exchange. </li>
